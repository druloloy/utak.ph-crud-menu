# Challenge: Simple CRUD for Menu

A restaurant needs to keep track of its sales. Code 1 page in React where the merchant can create all the items in their menu and save them. The merchant needs to be able to edit these items later and save them again.
Use Firebase Realtime Database to save the created items. You can use any npm packages you want. Use hooks rather than class components. How you design the UI should be the most user friendly experience you can think of.


Items will have:
- A Category
- A Name
- Some of them should have the ability to have options e.g. Fries - Small, Medium, Large
- Price
- A Cost
- Amount in stock
